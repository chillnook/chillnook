# Welcome to Daxen's GitHub! ðŸŒŸ

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  I am Daxen, commonly known as daxen.studio or DaxenDev.  I'm a 17-year-old developer from Canada who enjoys creating and problem solving.  I enjoy bringing ideas to life, whether it's via creating one-of-a-kind experiences, designing tools, or developing mods.

##  About Me
My programming experience began in 2016 when I experimented with Pocket Code, a mobile platform comparable to Scratch.  Since then, I've experimented with a variety of development techniques, including game design, web programming, modding, and automation.  I enjoy working with languages such as Lua, C#, C++, Java, and JavaScript, and I am constantly looking to learn more.

While I've worked on platforms like Roblox, where I created projects like Summer Hotels, Sword Fight Simulator, and Party Games, I've also worked on my own projects.  One of my favorites is the Uber Driver Mod for GTA 5, which garnered popularity within the gaming community and sparked some great collaborations.

##  My Approach
I'm always looking for effective and unique solutions to problems.  If something isn't quite right, I'm willing to revise it until it fits my expectations.  Outside of programming, I enjoy making music, working on mechanical projects, and doing hands-on jobs such as fixing and enhancing things.

##  Open to Work
I'm now available for work and partnership opportunities!  If you'd like to connect, please visit my [portfolio](https://daxen.studio/) to learn more about myself and my projects.

##  Whatâ€™s Next?
Looking forward, I intend to take on larger, more ambitious projects, eventually launching my own firm.  I'm enthusiastic to keep pushing my limitations, trying new things, and creating as a developer.
