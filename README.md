# Welcome to ChillNook's GitHub! 🌟

Hey there! 👋 I’m Daxen, also known as ChillNook. I’m a 17-year-old developer from Canada with a passion for creating and problem-solving. Whether it’s crafting unique experiences, building tools, or working on mods, I find joy in bringing ideas to life.

## 👤 About Me
My programming journey started in 2016 when I began experimenting with Pocket Code, a mobile platform similar to Scratch. Since then, I’ve explored a wide range of development areas, including game design, web programming, modding, and automation. I enjoy working with languages like Lua, C#, C++, Java, and JavaScript, and I’m always striving to learn more.

While I’ve developed on platforms like Roblox—where I’ve built projects such as Summer Hotels, Sword Fight Simulator, and Party Games—I’ve also worked on standalone projects. One of my favorites is the Uber Driver Mod for GTA 5, which gained recognition in the gaming community and led to some exciting collaborations.

## 💡 My Approach
I’m always seeking efficient and innovative solutions to challenges. If something isn’t quite right, I’m willing to rework it until it meets my standards. Outside of programming, I have a strong passion for creating music, working on mechanical projects, and tackling hands-on tasks like fixing and improving things.

## 🤝 Open to Work
I’m currently open to work and collaboration opportunities! If you’d like to connect, feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://chillnook.github.io/) for more information about me and my projects.

## 🚀 What’s Next?
Looking ahead, I’m planning to take on bigger, more ambitious projects and eventually start my own business. I’m excited to continue pushing my limits, exploring new ideas, and growing as a developer.
